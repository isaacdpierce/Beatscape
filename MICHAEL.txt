# Notes for Michael

## When viewing:

1. Does the tooltip hover directly under the headphones
2. Does the drawer line up

## Naming

I don't know what to name all the tracks - I made the shit up

We need to come up with a naming convention based on what the tracks are - naming important to programming

- make individual sound sprites
  
      - small pieces of individual sounds

      - some sounds come and go at the pace of walking by from one side of the sound to the other:
          eg. plane flying over head - small group of people walking by - car driving by - walking past a busy cafe - walking past a river or stream

      - some sounds are in the distance from a single spot: 
          eg. distant horn - howling wolf - flash rainfall - distant traffic -distant waterfall
  
make individual long-term atmosphere moments - rainfall - cafe - wind.
