# NOTES

## install styled components and deal with button -> a issue

## Create context

- set master volume that controls numbers in animated setting
- Create a base timer that all tracks will sync to

## Create useReducer for each track input range

## Create a master Volume

controls the max point that all tracks can go to
        - Probably need to set a minimal amount of track that will sit at the users chosen Volume
  
## Track timing

- Create a base timer that all tracks will sync to
- Volume fades in and out as tracks transition
