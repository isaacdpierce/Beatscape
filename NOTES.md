# NOTES

## Binaural not showing up
  
        - Check if volume can be affected with Slider component state
        - can it be imported into Store and set as the sound source?
  
## consider removing master volume - let master volume be controlled by device

## Create volume controller for binaural

        - set volume controller in slider??
        - eventually create a volume reducer for all sliders

## Create reducer for tracks

## Create Slider Style theme styled components

## Create Oscillator slider

## Create a base timer that all tracks will sync to

## Create useReducer for each track input range

## Create a master Volume

controls the max point that all tracks can go to
        - Probably need to set a minimal amount of track that will sit at the users chosen Volume
  
## Track timing

- Create a base timer that all tracks will sync to
- Volume fades in and out as tracks transition
