        - Check if volume can be affected with Slider component state
        - can it be imported into Store and set as the sound source?
  
## consider removing master volume - let master volume be controlled by device

## Create frequency controller for binaural

        - set volume controller in slider??
        - eventually create a volume reducer for all sliders

## Create a base timer that all tracks will sync to

        - Create a base timer that all tracks will sync to
        - Volume fades in and out as tracks transition
